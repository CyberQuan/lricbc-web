**3/23/25 Pastor’s Word**
Idolatrous Work

### Scripture Reading: Habakkuk 2:6–20

Faithfulness is not a superficial matter of uttering praises to God while we work. It is the act of putting God’s priorities first in our work. Habakkuk reminds that “the Lord is in his holy temple; let all the earth keep silence before him!” (Hab. 2:20). This silence is not merely a religious observation, but a silencing of our own broken ambitions, fears, and motivations, so that the priorities of God’s covenant can become our priorities. Those who exploit others’ vulnerabilities bring judgment on themselves. Work that oppresses or takes advantage of others ultimately brings about its own downfall.

Today we may not be literally crafting idols of precious materials before which we bow down. But work may also be idolatrous if we imagine that we are capable of producing our own salvation. For the essence of idolatry is that “its maker trusts in his own handiwork” (Hab. 2:18, NASB), rather than trusting in God by whose guidance and power we are created to work.

If we are ambitious for power and influence because we think without our wisdom, skill and leadership, our work group, company, organization, or nation is doomed, then our ambition is a form of idolatry. In contrast, if we are ambitious for power and influence so that we can draw others into a network of service in which everyone brings forth God’s gifts for the world, then our ambition is a form of faithfulness. If our response to success is self-congratulation, we are practicing idolatry. If our response is thankfulness, then we are worshiping God. If our reaction to failure is despair, then we are feeling the hollowness of a broken idol, but if our reaction is perseverance, then we are experiencing the saving power of God.

Prayer: Jesus, when I am tempted by the idols of pride and self-sufficiency in my work, help me instead to remember with thanksgiving that I have freely received all gifts from you. Thank you for making fruitful work possible. Amen.

For Further Exploration: Read Idolatrous Work (Habakkuk 2:1-20; Zephaniah 1:14-18) from the Theology of Work Bible Commentary.

工作中的偶像崇拜

### 阅读经文：哈巴谷书2:6-20

对神忠心不是在工作中肤浅地口头上赞美神，而是把神的优先事项摆在首位。先知哈巴谷提醒我们：“惟耶和华在他的圣殿中，全地的人都当在他面前肃敬静默！”（哈2:20）。这种静默不仅仅是遵循一个宗教的仪式，而是让我们破碎的雄心、恐惧和动力保持静默，好让神圣约的优先事项成为我们的优先事项。那些利用他人弱点的人为自己招来审判。压迫或者利用他人的工作最终会导致自己衰败。

今天我们可能不会用贵重的材料来制作偶像，在其面前跪拜。但如果我们想像自己有能力实现自我的救赎，那麽工作也可能成为偶像。因为偶像崇拜的本质是“制造者倚靠自己铸造出来的偶像”（哈2:18），而不是信靠那带领并赐给我们能力去工作的神。

如果我们雄心勃勃的想要获得权力和影响力，是因为以为离了智慧、才能和领导力，我们的工作群体、公司、组织或国家就注定会失败，那我们的雄心就是一种偶像崇拜。相比之下，若我们志向远大的想要获得权力和影响力，是为吸引别人进入服事的网络关系中，在其中每个人都把神的恩赐带给世人，那么这样的雄心就是一种忠心。如果成功了我们洋洋自得，就是在拜偶像。如果我们向神感恩，就是在敬拜神。如果对失败的反应是沮丧，那么我们感受到的是偶像破碎之后的空虚。如果反应是不屈不挠，我们就正在经历神拯救的大能。
