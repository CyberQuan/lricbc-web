每日默想 —— Santi Lalis

Thoughts of the Day— by Santi Lalis

The devotional was from last Sunday.

Today is Easter Sunday! It commemorates Jesus’ resurrection from the dead! This is one of the most festive events among Christians because Jesus not only conquered death and sins but gives believers hope to have eternal life!

We talked yesterday, Good Friday that the women who went home to prepare for spices and oil to anoint Jesus’s body for burial were not able to finish the job because the time for Sabbath had started. So, very early this Easter Sunday morning, the women led by Mary Magdalene came back with their prepared spices and oil but found that the tomb was already opened and Jesus’ body was not there. They saw two angels dressed in dazzling white clothes and told them that Jesus was not there because He had risen! The women could not believe it so they ran back and told the disciples what they saw. Peter and John came and found only the linen cloths that was wrapped on Jesus’s body. Bewildered and confused, they went home, but Mary Magdalene stayed outside the tomb crying. Suddenly she saw Jesus standing but did not recognize Him at first. Jesus asked “Why are you crying! “Who are you looking for.” Mary thought He was the gardener, she said, “Sir, if you have taken Him away, tell me where, I will take Him.” Jesus said, “Mary.” Then by that voice, she recognizes it was Jesus! Jesus warned not to cling to Him because He has not yet return to the Father. Jesus told him to tell His disciples.

Mary Magdalene was the first person Jesus saw and talked to after His resurrection. Then later that day he joined walking with two people who were talking about what latest happening in Jerusalem especially the crucifixion of the “man from Nazareth”. They did not recognize Jesus not until He broke the bread when He was invited to spend the night and eat supper with them. Jesus, met many other people before ascending to heaven, the ones was when He met His 11 remaining disciples and told them,” Go into the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.”

But what is the significance of Jesus’ resurrection to us Christians?

The resurrection of Christ is the central doctrine of Christianity! Without resurrection, there is no Christianity, and our preaching is in vain!

The resurrection is based on the belief that Jesus was raised from the dead on the third day of His resurrection and that through His conquering of death, all believers will subsequently share in His victory over sin and death!

On His resurrection, Jesus is showing to us that the power that raised Him from the dead is the same power that will raise all of us, if we believe in Him!

Without the resurrection of Christ, humanity will live in the realm of materialism!

For the believers in Jesus Christ, the greatest event in human life is the resurrection of Christ because it led to our salvation!

The resurrection gives credence and authenticity to the Christian faith. For without resurrection, there is no Christianity to talk about, there is no hope of eternal life!

If there is no resurrection from the dead, then Christ is not risen, and if Christ be not risen, then our preaching is in vain, and our faith also in vain (1 Corinthians 15:14-15).

Without the resurrection, humanity will perish under the yoke and bondage of sin and wickedness! In resurrection, we are buried with Christ in the baptism of faith as Christ was raised from the dead to walk in the newness of life! Resurrection means that sin shall not have dominion over us, for we are not under the law, but of grace! (Romans 6:14). One of the greatest benefits of the resurrection of Christ is to know that someday, despite the sufferings and anguish of this world, we will resurrect after death and live with Jesus forever in paradise!

Happy Easter to us all! Stay safe and healthy! Celebrate fully the Risen Christ! God bless us all!

摘自上周主日的灵修

今天是复活节主日！

复活节是纪念耶稣从死里复活的重要节日！

这是基督徒最喜乐、最值得庆祝的节期之一，因为耶稣不仅战胜了死亡和罪恶，更赐给信祂之人永生的盼望！

受难日（Good Friday）我们谈到那些妇女——她们回家预备香料和香膏，要膏抹耶稣的身体，以便埋葬。但因为安息日已经开始，她们未能完成这项准备工作。

所以在今天复活节主日的清晨，抹大拉的马利亚带领众妇女再次带着所准备的香料来到坟墓，结果发现墓门已开，耶稣的身体不见了！

她们见到两位穿着耀眼白衣的天使，天使告诉她们：“耶稣不在这里，因为祂已经复活了！”

妇女们起初难以置信，便跑回去把所见所闻告诉门徒。彼得和约翰赶来，只看见耶稣包裹身体的细麻布。他们惊讶困惑，便回去了。

但马利亚却仍站在墓外哭泣。忽然，她看见耶稣站在那里，但起初并没有认出祂。耶稣问她：“你为什么哭？你找谁？”

马利亚以为祂是园丁，就说：“先生，如果是你把祂移走了，请告诉我祂在哪里，我好把祂带回。”

### 耶稣叫她：“马利亚！”

她听见这个声音才认出是耶稣！

耶稣告诉她不要拉住祂，因为祂还没有升到父那里，并要她去告诉门徒。

抹大拉的马利亚是耶稣复活后第一个见到祂、与祂说话的人。

那天稍晚，耶稣还与两位前往以马忤斯的门徒同行，他们正谈论着在耶路撒冷所发生的事情，尤其是那“来自拿撒勒之人的被钉十字架”。

他们起初也没有认出耶稣，直到邀请祂一同住下并吃晚饭时，耶稣擘饼，他们才认出祂来。

在升天之前，耶稣还向许多人显现，包括祂那剩下的十一位门徒，并对他们说：“你们要往普天下去，传福音给万民听。”

那么，耶稣的复活对我们基督徒来说，有何意义呢？

耶稣的复活是基督信仰的核心真理！

若没有复活，就没有基督教，我们的讲道就毫无意义！

### 基督复活的教义基于这样的信仰：

耶稣在第三天从死里复活，并且藉着祂胜过死亡，所有信祂的人也将一同分享祂战胜罪与死的得胜！

### 祂的复活向我们表明：那使耶稣从死里复活的大能，也要叫我们复活，只要我们信靠祂！

若没有基督的复活，人类将活在纯粹的物质主义之中，没有永恒、没有指望。对信主的基督徒来说，人类历史上最伟大的事件莫过于基督的复活——因为这带来了我们的救恩！

复活为基督信仰带来权威和真实性。

若没有复活，我们就没有基督教、没有永生的盼望！

### 保罗在哥林多前书15章14–15节说得很清楚：

“若基督没有复活，我们所传的便是枉然，你们所信的也是枉然。”

没有复活，人类将永远活在罪恶与邪恶的捆绑下！但在复活中，我们与基督同死、同埋葬、同复活，就如我们藉着信心的洗礼归入祂的死，也与祂一同活出新生命！

复活意味着：罪不能再辖制我们，因为我们不在律法之下，乃在恩典之下！（罗马书6:14）

### 基督复活带来的最大福气之一就是：

有一天，纵然这世界充满苦难与痛苦，我们死后仍要复活，永远与耶稣同在天堂！

🎉 复活节快乐！愿我们都平安、健康，满心欢喜地庆祝复活的基督！ 愿神赐福我们每一个人!
