**12/14/25 Pastor’s Word**
Boaz or Bozo?

David &amp; I have been married for 29 years this coming May. He has always signed his cards to me, “Love, Boaz” &amp; I have always signed mine to him, “Love, Ruth.” In the Bible, the book of Ruth is the most beautiful love story of commitment ever told. Mine and David’s story is similar to theirs.

Ruth was a widow, I was discarded; so, we both were no longer loved or cared for. This is not a sad story for either of us. It is a story with a happy ending.

So, hang in there…..

When Boaz crossed paths with Ruth, he immediately was drawn to her beauty and kindness.  But, back in those days, he was 2nd in line as a suiter. There was another man who had the right to marry her. Boaz went to the man and asked if he was interested in Ruth as a wife. If he had been, he would have had to take care of her mother-in-law as part of the “package deal.” He said, “In that case, no.” Even though  Ruth was a beautiful, kind, Christian woman, he did not want to have the responsibility of caring for her mother-in-law.

When David became interested in me, I, like Ruth came with some family commitments. He loved me no matter what. We got married &amp; he took responsibility for his daughter, who was 8 years old, &amp; my granddaughter, who was 4 years old.

As the years when by, my elderly mother came to live with us 6 months out of the year (my sister, Pam &amp; her “Boaz” husband, Rob, had Mom for the other 6 months) for 8 years we cared for her in our homes. When my biological grandson was born, we took him to raise from the age of 7 months old until this day. He is 20 now. David loves him as though he was his own child, it was an instant love at first sight.  We adopted him when he turned 12.

Do you have daughters? Do you have sons? If you do have a daughter, it would be wise for you to be praying for her future husband to be a “Boaz.” If you have a son, you should be raising him to be a “Boaz.” What is a Boaz? You asked. To me the definition of a “Boaz” is “a stand-up guy,” in today’s language.

Boaz was a “Kinsman Redeemer” for Ruth. That meant he took the place of the man that did not want her &amp; anyone else that came with her. Boaz loved Ruth, so it was his heart’s desire to marry her, no matter what. David was my “Kinsman Redeemer” who took me to love, when I was discarded. He also took, my mother, my granddaughter, his daughter, and my grandson…..who became our child….with not even a hint of hesitation.

The happy ending to this story is, Ruth &amp; I got “Boaz,” when it was possible we could have ended up with “Bozo.”  That only happened, because we chose to “wait on God” to finish our stories.

When you receive this card, know that we prayed for you.

Ladies, I hope you have a Boaz in your life, and if not, that someday you will.

Men, I hope you represent Boaz in every way, just like David, my “stand up guy.”

Merry Christmas from our house to yours,

David, Sandi and Rett

波阿斯还是小丑？

到明年五月，我和大卫将迎来结婚29周年。他一直在写给我的卡片上签名“愛你的，波阿斯（Boaz）”，而我也一直在写给他的卡片上签名“愛你的，路得（Ruth）”。在圣经中，《路得记》是一个关于委身的最美愛情故事。我和大卫的故事，也与他们颇为相似。

路得曾是寡妇，而我曾被遗弃；我们都曾经不再被愛、不再被珍惜。但对我们两位来说，这并不是悲伤的故事，而是一个拥有幸福结局的故事。

所以，请坚持下去……

当波阿斯与路得相遇时，他立刻被她的美丽与善良吸引。但依照当时的习俗，波阿斯并非第一位有资格娶路得的人；另有一位更近亲的男子比他更有优先权。波阿斯便去询问那位男子是否愿意娶路得为妻；若娶，照顾她的婆婆则是不得不选择的“配套条件”。那人一听要承担照顾婆婆的责任，便说：“那我就不要了。”尽管路得美丽、善良、敬虔，那人仍不愿承担责任。

当大卫开始喜欢我时，就像路得一样——我也带着家庭责任一起“嫁过来”。但他无条件地愛我。我们结婚后，他承担起照顾他八岁的女儿、还有我四岁的外孙女的责任。

多年以后，我年迈的母亲开始到我们家与我们同住，一年住六个月（另外六个月在我妹妹帕姆和她的“波阿斯”丈夫罗伯家），我们前后照顾她八年之久。后来，我亲生的外孙出生，我们从他七个月大时就将他带来抚养至今。他现在已经20岁了。大卫愛他视如己出，是一见钟情般的愛。当他12岁时，我们正式收养了他。

你有女儿吗？你有儿子吗？你若有女儿，为她的未来丈夫祷告，使他成为一个“波阿斯”是智慧的；你若有儿子，你应当培养他成为一个“波阿斯”。你会问，什么是“波阿斯”？对我而言，“波阿斯”的定义就是今日语言中的“可靠、有担当的真男人”。

波阿斯是路得的“至亲救赎者”，意味着他愿替代那不愿接纳路得的人，承担路得和她所带来的一切。波阿斯愛路得，因此他渴望娶她，无论代价如何。而大卫就是我的“至亲救赎者”。当我被遗弃时，他接纳了我；他也接纳了我的母亲、我的外孙女、他的女儿以及我的外孙——后来成为我们的孩子——他接纳这一切时毫不犹豫。

故事的幸福结局是：路得和我都得到了我们的“波阿斯”Boaz，而不是“Bozo（小丑）”。这得以发生，只因为我们选择“等候上帝”来完成我们的故事。

当你收到这张卡片，请知道，我们为你祷告。

女士们，我愿你生命中也拥有一个波阿斯；若尚未拥有，愿将来遇见。

男士们，我盼望你们都能成为波阿斯般的人，就像大卫——我的“真男人”。

圣诞快乐！从我们家到你家

注：Sandi是我们在奥克拉荷马的老朋友。我们每年收到的第一份圣诞卡和圣诞信一定是她寄来的。她今年写的圣诞信“波阿斯还是小丑？”沁人心肺，字里行间洋溢着基督愛里的温暖与祝福，以及“真男人”的委身与担当。当我们庆祝基督降生时，愿这份主里的愛也融化你的心。
