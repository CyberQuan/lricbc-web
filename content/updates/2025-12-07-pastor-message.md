CALLED TO OVERCOME

Elinda West

Sharing at Early Morning Prayer on 10/28/2025

1 John  5:4-5; Romans 8: 35-37; John 16:33; Revelation 21:7: 2 Corinthians 1:3-4

A pastor wrote: “All of us want every day to be a good day! But if every day was a good day, there would be NO ‘Good Days”, because there wouldn’t be any bad days to compare the good days to…... Sickness helps us appreciate health. Failure helps us appreciate success.  Debt helps us appreciate wealth. And the tough times help us appreciate the good times….

ADVERSITY is often an opportunity to bring the good out of us and of course it can bring bad out of us too, but with God’s help let’s DON’T let that happen!  Adversity CAN be a blessing in disguise.

We are not promised a trouble-free life, but we are promised we can have peace in Jesus when life is troublesome!  We imagine what life would be like without any problems or issues or challenges, but that might be hazardous to our health, especially our spiritual health! In our physical health if we don’t move around or take exercise soon, we lose our muscle mass and bone density. We know that…. because when there is long term sickness, we see it happen. Even older people in America who just want to sit down because they have pain, if they sit too much and too long and don’t move, they really will have more pain and become immobile! Maybe we really do need some adversity in our lives even though we don’t like it. I heard a statement that said, “The people God uses the most are often the people who have experienced the most adversity.”

This isn’t what we want to hear but it’s true. There is a sister that comes to my mind in America. Her name is Joni. When she was a teenager, she dove into a lake and broke her neck and was paralyzed from neck down all her life. She is in her 70’s now. It was a tragedy, and she was angry and depressed for a while, but she trusted the Lord and He strengthened her, so even though she has suffered all her life, she has a powerful testimony of God’s help and leading her to encourage thousands of people with her testimony. She can speak so she teaches on the internet, and she goes to speak to groups of people. She paints beautiful art with her mouth and teeth holding a brush. She writes books and poetry.

If you look up the meaning of OVERCOME you see it means subdue, prevail, and conquer. We will have many trials on this earth but there is nothing that our God cannot conquer! Overcomers are followers of Christ who successfully resist the power and temptation of the world’s system.  An overcomer is NOT sinless!  But they hold on to faith in Christ until the end. He does not turn away when times get difficult.  Overcoming requires complete dependence upon God for direction, purpose, fulfillment and strength to follow God’s plan for our lives. Adversity can produce an increased capacity to serve God. Why? Because adversity causes us like Joni to turn to God, lean on God, seek God and get to know God in a way we otherwise would not.

Some of God’s greatest promises in Scripture begin with the words “to him who overcomes”. In our scripture we read this morning it says,” for everyone born of God overcomes the world. This is the victory that has overcome the world, even our faith”. 1John vs 4-5. Who is it that overcomes the world? ONLY he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.” .... So, we are CALLED to be OVERCOMERS! We see in Romans 8: 35-37 The troubles and hardships do not separate us from God’s Love. vs 37 says “... in all these things we are more than conquerors through HIM who loves us.” The sovereign power of God’s love can protect and preserve us who are believers! Where in your life do you need the healing power of these precious truths?  Where do you need rescue? Please remember this…. You shall OVERCOME because your Heavenly Father Himself IS the OVERCOMER!!  Praise God! We’ve seen and believed in the depth of His love because of His sacrifice.

Faith is the victory that overcomes the world! He gives us divine strength and power to be overcomers! And Jesus wants us to have peace because He knows that for a time …until He returns… The world is a battleground, not a playground! Jesus tells us in John 16:33…. this world is broken, and we will have troubles (adversity) We must put on God’s armor and stand firm!  Jesus says, “BUT take heart (be encouraged) I have overcome the world!” Even when we try our best to be faithful, we will still have struggles. How do we respond?  We remain faithful and thanks be to God; He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. We are “the church,” the family of God, the body of believers. We believe in Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah and our Savior! The church gives evidence of this belief by obeying God’s commands. Such obedience OVERCOMES the temptations thrown at us by the NON-BELIEVING world to live by its standards. We can obey ONLY as we place our faith in Christ and not ourselves.  The motivation for obedience is LOVE OF GOD and we extend that love to everyone! We support one another with love and prayers. Obedience, faith, and love unite the church into a true community! In Revelations 21: 7 we read, “He who overcomes will inherit all this and I will be His God, and he will be my son.”  So, the Christian church is an enduring, OVERCOMING people. One day problems and persecution will be behind.  God’s enduring people will receive their inheritance! Brothers and Sisters be encouraged…we have the Holy Spirit of God IN US to OVERCOME any attacks of the enemy!

Did you know God wants to recycle your adversity and turn it into a ministry. People go through and endure very painful things, but God can help us to climb out of the pit so we can help others. Our problems don’t disqualify us from being used by God. We don’t want tragedy or adversity in our lives, but good things can come from it. Trials have a way of helping us rediscover our purpose in life. The problems God has brought you through become a platform where you stand and minister to others. “Praise be to God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of ALL comfort, who comforts us in our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.”  This is my sharing, let us pray!

被呼召成为得胜者

魏师母

2025年10月28日 晨更祷告会分享

经文：约翰一书 5:4-5；罗马书 8:35-37；约翰福音 16:33；启示录 21:7；哥林多后书 1:3-4

一位牧师曾写道：“我们都希望每天都是好日子！但如果每天都是好日子，其实就没有所谓‘好日子’，因为没有坏日子来衬托……疾病让我们更懂得珍惜健康；失败让我们更懂得珍惜成功；缺乏让我们更懂得珍惜富足；艰难让我们更懂得珍惜顺境…… 逆境（ADVERSITY）往往是一个机会，让我们里面的美善被带出来，当然它也可能带出我们的软弱，但在神的帮助下，让我们不要（DON’T）让那种情况发生！逆境可以（CAN）成为化妆的祝福。

神没有应许我们过一个没有问题的生活，但祂应许我们：在困难的日子里，我们可以在耶稣里得着平安！我们常幻想没有问题、没有冲突、没有挑战的生活是什么样，但那反而可能危害我们的健康，尤其是属灵健康！在身体健康方面，如果我们不活动、不锻炼，很快就会失去肌肉量和骨密度。我们都知道这一点……因为当人长期生病，就会看到这样的结果。在美国，许多年长者因为疼痛而常常久坐不动，但如果坐得太久、动得太少，反而会更痛，最后甚至无法行动！也许我们真的需要一些逆境，尽管我们不喜欢它。我听过一句话说：“神最常使用的人，往往是那些经历了最多逆境的人。”

这不是我们想听的，但却是真理。有位在美国的姊妹浮现在我脑海中。她叫 Joni。青少年时，她跳入湖中，不慎折断颈椎，从颈部以下终生瘫痪。她现在七十多岁了。这是一场悲剧，她也曾愤怒、沮丧，但她选择信靠主，主加力量给她。虽一生受苦，但她却拥有极有能力的见证，鼓励了成千上万的人。她能说话，所以她在网上教导，也参加聚会分享。她用嘴巴含着画笔创作精美画作，也写书、写诗。

若查“得胜（OVERCOME）”的意思，会发现它有制服、胜过、胜利之意。在世上我们必有许多试炼，但没有什么是我们的神不能胜过的！得胜者（Overcomers）是那些属基督的人，他们胜过世界体系的权势和试探。得胜者不是无罪的人！但他们持守对基督的信心直到最后。当环境艰难时，他们不转身退后。得胜需要我们完全依靠神来引导、指示、成全，并赐力量让我们遵行祂的计划。逆境能让我们有更深的能力来服事神。为什么？因为逆境使我们像 Joni 一样转向神、倚靠神、寻求神，并以我们原本不会经历的方式更深地认识神。

圣经中许多最伟大的应许都以这几个字开始：“那得胜的（to him who overcomes）。” 今天读的经文说：“因为凡从神生的，就胜过（overcomes）世界；使我们胜了世界的，就是我们的信心。”（约一 5:4-5）谁能胜过世界呢？只有信耶稣是神儿子的！所以我们被呼召（CALLED）成为得胜者（OVERCOMERS）！

罗马书 8:35-37 提醒我们：患难、困苦都不能使我们与神的爱隔绝。37 节说：“……靠着爱我们的主，在这一切的事上已经得胜有余（more than conquerors）了。” 神那主权且不变的爱，能保守我们这些信祂的人！你生命中哪里需要这些真理所带来的医治之力？你在哪里需要神的拯救？请记住：你必定得胜（shall OVERCOME），因为你的天父自己就是那得胜者（the OVERCOMER）！赞美主！因祂的牺牲，我们看见并经历了祂深切的爱。

信心是胜过世界的力量！祂赐我们属天的力量，使我们成为得胜者！耶稣要我们得平安，因为祂深知：直到祂再来之前……这个世界是战场，不是游乐场！耶稣在约翰福音 16:33 告诉我们：这世界是破碎的，我们会有患难。我们必须穿戴神的全副军装，站立得稳！耶稣说：“但你们可以放心（被鼓励），我已经胜了（I have overcome）世界！” 即使我们尽力忠心，依旧会有挣扎。我们如何回应？继续忠心！感谢神，祂藉着我们的主耶稣基督赐给我们得胜。

我们是“教会”，是神的家，是信徒的身体。我们承认耶稣是应许中的弥赛亚、是救主！教会藉着遵行神的命令来见证我们的信仰。这样的顺服胜过（OVERCOMES）世界不信者所带来的生活方式试探。我们只有靠信靠基督，而不是倚靠自己，才能顺服。顺服的动机是爱神，并将这爱延伸给每一个人！我们彼此扶持、彼此祷告。顺服、信心与爱，使教会成为真正的群体！启示录 21:7 说：“得胜的（He who overcomes）必承受这些为业；我要作他的神，他要作我的儿子。” 所以，基督的教会是一群恒久、得胜的（OVERCOMING）子民。有一天，一切的问题、逼迫都会过去。神所保守的子民必得着他们的产业！弟兄姊妹，请得到激励……我们里面有圣灵，祂使我们能够胜过（OVERCOME）一切仇敌的攻击！

你知道吗？神愿意“回收”（recycle）你的逆境，把它变成一个事工。人会经历非常痛苦的事，但神可以帮助我们从深坑中出来，好叫我们去帮助别人。我们的问题不会使我们失去被神使用的资格。我们不渴望悲剧或逆境，但从中却能生出益处。试炼反而帮助我们重新找到生命的目的。神带我们走过的那些苦难，成为我们站立并服事他人的平台。

“愿颂赞归与我们的主耶稣基督的父神，就是那慈悲的父、赐各样安慰的神！祂在我们一切患难中安慰我们，叫我们能用神所赐的安慰去安慰遭遇各样患难的人。”（林后 1:3-4）这是我的分享，我们一起祷告!
