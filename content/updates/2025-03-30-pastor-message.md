**3/30/25 Pastor’s Word**
The Vine

I have a dear brother in Harbin whose son’s nickname is “Grape.”

Perhaps we could name the 2025 updated digital album of Little Rock Immanuel Chinese Baptist Church “The Vine.”

Jesus said, “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful” (John 15:1-2).

The vine does not have the evergreen nature of the palm tree, nor the proud resilience of the pine, nor the opportunity to become the beams of the temple like the cedar. With its intertwining roots and sprawling branches, the vine grows under the lush shade with only one purpose—to bear fruit.

This fruit is the fruit of the Spirit—it is the outflow of life, the work of winning souls like fishers of men, the power of devout prayers, and the impact of the kingdom of heaven.

The Father has a wonderful plan. In 1998, He planted this vine at Immanuel Baptist Church, establishing it as a “Mission Church.” On November 14, 2021, she officially became an autonomous church under the full name Little Rock Immanuel Chinese Baptist Church. On July 3, 2022, the church moved to Markham Street for worship.

Jesus is the true vine, and the Father is the gardener. Jesus became flesh, accomplished salvation on the cross, and rose from the dead on the third day, becoming the foundation of the vine. The Great Commission—to preach the gospel and make disciples of all nations— is the goal that the Church strives to pursue. The Lord’s return is our motivation and source of encouragement to remain watchful in prayer, diligent in preparation, loving one another, and exhorting each other.

The Spirit provides nourishment to the vine and prunes it at the right time. The Spirit is like a sharp pair of shears—He lovingly yet firmly prunes us so that we may bear even more fruit. He removes our self-righteousness, weakness, pride, arrogance, greed, and impurity. When we sin, He convicts us; when we are lost, He enlightens us; when we grieve, He comforts us; when we stumble, He upholds us—all so that we may glorify the name of the Lord.

The Lord gives only one command to this vine: Remain in Him, that is, to remain in His Word, and remain in His love.

With gratitude, we proclaim that this vine’s motto: Witness Christ &amp; Impact the World!

With gratitude, we uphold this vine’s vision: But we will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on us; we will be the Lord’s witnesses in Little Rock, and in Arkansas and the United States, and to the world!

With gratitude, we embrace this vine’s mission statement: Keeping the Covenant Faithfully, Worshipping the Lord Sincerely, Having Fellowship Harmoniously, Loving Each Other Genuinely, Making Disciples Continuously, and Sharing the Gospel Passionately.

With gratitude, we cherish this vine’s core values: Family, Next Generation, Prayer,

Love Caring, Service, Godliness, Holiness, and Truth

With gratitude, we witness this vine moving forward with unprecedented vitality—spreading the gospel, building up the church, magnifying the Lord’s name, and preparing to take next step boldly into the future.

We have faith, we have love, and we have hope, because we are a vine planted by the Father, established by Jesus, and nurtured by the Spirit. Spring has come to Little Rock—the flowers are blooming, the white birds are singing, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. The fig tree ripens with its early fruit, and the vine blossoms, spreading its fragrance. The time of great opportunity has arrived!

Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climbed over the wall.

LRICBC is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a well, and its branches extend beyond the walls, bearing abundant fruit!

葡萄树

我在哈尔滨认识的一位好弟兄家的儿子小名唤“葡萄”；

我们或许可以为小石城以马内利华语浸信会2025版更新的电子相册命名为“葡萄树”。

耶稣说：“我是真葡萄树，我父是栽培的人。凡属我不结果子的枝子，祂就剪去；凡结果子的，祂就修理干净，使枝子结果子更多”（约15: 1-2）。

葡萄树没有棕树的四季常青，没有松树的傲骨耐寒，更没有像香柏树那样成为圣殿中栋梁之材的良机。葡萄树盘根错节，枝蔓舒展，幽幽绿荫生长的唯一价值就是去结果子。

这果子是圣灵的果子，是生命的流露， 是得人如得渔的事工，是虔诚祈祷所发出的力量，是天国的影响力。

天父有美好的计划。1998年天父在以马内利浸信会栽种了这颗葡萄树，成为以马内利浸信会的福音堂。2021年11月14日，她正式成为独立的教会，全名为：小石城以马内利华语浸信会。2022年7月3日，她搬到Markham Street 崇拜。

耶稣是真葡萄树，天父是栽培的人。耶稣道成肉身，在十字架上成全救恩，三日后死里复活成了葡萄树的根基。主的大使命——传福音使万民做主门徒的是教会竭力追求的标杆，主的再来是我们警醒祷告、殷勤预备、彼此相愛、互相劝勉的动力和泉源。

圣灵供应葡萄树的养分，并适时修剪。圣灵如一把锋利的剪刀，他为了让我们结果子更多便不断忍心修理我们，除掉我们的自义、软弱、骄傲、狂妄、贪婪、和不洁。圣灵在我们犯罪时责备我们，迷茫时光照我们，难过时安慰我们，失脚时扶举我们，为要使我们见证主的圣名。

### 主给这颗葡萄树唯一的命令是：要常住在主里面——常住在主的话里，常住在主的爱里。

### 感恩，这颗葡萄树的标语是：“见证基督，影响世界！”

感恩，这颗葡萄树的异象是：“但圣灵降临在我们身上，我们就必得着能力，并要在小石城、阿肯色州、全美国，直到世界各地，做主的见证！”

感恩，这颗葡萄树的使命宣言是：“忠于圣约、敬虔崇拜、合一团契、真诚相愛、训练门徒，并广传福音。”

感恩，这颗葡萄树的核心价值是：“家庭、下一代、祈祷、愛心关怀、服侍、敬虔，圣洁和真理。”

感恩，这颗葡萄树正在以前所未有的活力继续传扬福音、建立教会，彰显主名，并整装待发、准备勇敢地迈向下一步。

我们有信心、我们有愛心、我们有盼望，因为我们是天父所栽种、耶稣所树立、圣灵所经营的葡萄树。小石城的春天百花开放，白鸟鸣叫的时候已经来到，斑鸠的声音在我们境内也听见了，无花果树的果子渐渐成熟，葡萄树开花放香，大好良机已经来到。

约瑟是多结果子的枝子，是泉旁多结果子的枝子，他的枝条探出墙外；

小石城以马内利华语浸信会是多结果子的葡萄树，是井旁多结果子的枝子，她探出墙外的枝条硕果累累！
