“Glorify God and Benefit People”

— How Chinese Christians Can Celebrate the Lunar New Year

In 1951, American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, in his book Christ and Culture, proposed five models of the relationship between Christ and culture:

Christ Against Culture: Culture is corrupted by sin, and Christians should avoid, reject, or resist it.

Christ of Culture: Culture is inherently good and poses no conflict with Christian faith.

Christ Above Culture: Culture is good but requires Christian faith to interpret it in its most beautiful form.

Christ and Culture in Paradox: There is a continuous tension between Christians and the culture they interact with.

Christ the Transformer of Culture: Christians strive to transform cultural values and purposes into instruments of service and glory to God.

Due to space constraints, we will not elaborate on these points in detail. Most evangelical Christians agree with the fifth model. According to Jesus’ teaching, we are “the light of the world, the salt of the earth” (Matthew 5:13-16), living in the world but not of the world (John 17:15-17), approaching worldly life with a transcendent mindset, renewed by God (Romans 12:1-2).

The Lunar New Year is the most important festival for Chinese people and a core part of Chinese culture. Chinese Christians living overseas must balance Chinese culture, Western culture, and Christian culture, making it essential to glorify God and benefit people. Referring to Niebuhr’s “Christ the Transformer of Culture” model, and based on Paul’s words, “So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God” (1 Corinthians 10:31), I share the following practical suggestions:

1. Worship the One True God

Christians should honor God above all, worshipping only the one true God, and never idols (Exodus 20:1–5; Deuteronomy 5:7–9). During the Lunar New Year, be careful to avoid participating in or promoting practices such as “receiving gods,” offering sacrifices, pasting images of the god of Wealth or door gods, welcoming the god of Wealth, drawing lots, or fortune-telling. Do not speak or spread the names of other gods (Psalm 16:4).

We respect every person but do not elevate anyone by calling them “god.” Do not call celebrities or online personalities “male god” or “female god,” do not treat God’s servants as gods (Acts 14:14–18), and do not treat angels as gods (Revelation 22:8-9). In prayer, we address God as “Almighty,” not as an abstract “universal power.”

Prayer should be offered with a humble and repentant heart, but there is no need to add phrases such as “this unworthy prayer,” because we may approach God with confidence, based entirely on the salvation accomplished by Christ on the cross. Posting “Fu-Blessing”  characters, gospel couplets, or wearing traditional ethnic clothing such as Tang suits or minority costumes, as long as they do not involve idol worship, is purely cultural expression and perfectly acceptable.

2. Honor Ancestors but Do Not Worship Them

Christians may honor ancestors but must not worship them. We should hold a heart of respect and remembrance, not perform worship or sacrifices. Chinese culture emphasizes filial piety (“filial piety comes first among all virtues”), and the Fifth Commandment in the Bible also stresses honoring parents. Christian filial piety focuses on caring for elders during their lifetime: sharing the gospel, showing care, helping with chores, and expressing gratitude through actions.

During traditional tomb-sweeping, we may remember the exemplary lives of our elders and appreciate their contributions. Tomb-sweeping should not include kowtowing, burning paper, or offering sacrifices; flowers may be presented, and hymns sung. Prayers are directed to God for the joy and peace of the living, not the dead, thereby glorifying God and providing a genuine witness to others.

3. Once Belonged to Animal, Now Belong to Christ

The zodiac is a cultural symbol in Chinese tradition: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig. It corresponds to years and time cycles, but for Christians, it is merely a cultural marker without spiritual substance. What truly determines a person’s identity is whether they belong to Christ.

This year is the Year of the Horse. The Bible mentions horses primarily in connection with strength, war, and reliance on military power. Psalm 147:10 says, “He does not delight in the strength of the horse; he takes no pleasure in the legs of a man,” reminding us not to rely on human ability, speed, or even technological advances and artificial intelligence; rather, those who fear Him and hope in His steadfast love are pleasing to God (Psalm 147:11). Revelation 19:11-21 records Jesus riding a white horse to execute judgment, demonstrating His authority and victory.

Therefore, when Christians exchange blessings during the “Year of the Horse,” it is not about the luck of the zodiac, but about the presence of Christ. The expressions “Immanuel, joy comes swiftly” and “Immanuel, blessings surround immediately” are not truly about the “horse,” but about Immanuel—God with us. Regardless of the zodiac year, we should proclaim: this year belongs to Christ.

In daily greetings, people often ask, “Which animal do you belong to?” We may witness: “I once belonged to the Sheep (or Horse, Snake), but now I belong to Christ.” As Paul said, “But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of Christ… I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord” (Philippians 3:7-8). Moving from belonging to animal to belonging to Christ is a declaration of life’s true identity, demonstrating grace rather than cultural labels.

4. Practice Moderation in Eating and Drinking

During Lunar New Year reunions, families enjoy abundant meals. Christians may practice moderation in eating and drinking, as our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20). Healthy living glorifies God and enables us to bless others. Smoking harms health; out of love for the body, Christians may choose not to smoke. If one has the habit, one can rely on the Holy Spirit to overcome it, bearing victorious testimony for the Lord. For example, my grandmother and my American mom both smoked for decades, but through the power of the Lord, they successfully quit, encouraging those around them.

Christians should also avoid drunkenness (Ephesians 5:18), as excessive drinking leads to loss of self-control. By relying on the Holy Spirit, we pursue a sanctified life, avoiding situations that might cause us to stumble. “Sanctification” does not merely mean outwardly refraining from sin, but living in accordance with God’s will and glorifying Him, making every daily choice a testimony of faith.

5. Seize Opportunities to Share the Gospel

Sharing the gospel is the mission of every Christian, and we must proclaim it at all times (2 Timothy 4:2). During the festival, when calling or texting relatives to wish them a happy new year, we may naturally share the gospel. At celebrations, we can also share the gospel with others and invite them to attend church gatherings. If someone does not accept, we need not insist, but continue maintaining good relationships so that the Lord’s love and our testimony may have a lasting impact.

May the Lord bless us in the new year: increasing our strength, grace, honor, and joy! May His grace overflow, our cups be full of blessings, and “for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea” (Hab 2:14). In the name of Christ, Amen!

“荣神益人”——华人基督徒如何过春节？

1951年，美国神学家莱因霍尔德·尼布尔（Reinhold Niebuhr）在《基督与文化》（Christ and Culture）一书中提出基督徒与文化之间的五种关系模式：

第一，    基督反对文化（Christ Against Culture）：文化受罪玷污，基督徒应避免、拒绝或排斥文化。

第二，    基督属于文化（Christ of Culture）：文化本身良善，与基督徒信仰无冲突。

第三，    基督高于文化（Christ above Culture）：文化良善，但需由基督信仰作最美的诠释。

第四，    基督与文化之间的张力（Christ and Culture in Paradox）：基督徒与文化互动中存在持续紧张。

第五，    基督更新文化（Christ the Transformer of Culture）：基督徒努力将文化价值观与目的转化为服侍与荣耀神的工具。

篇幅有限，这里不详细展开。多数福音派基督徒认同第五种模式，即按耶稣教导成为“世上的光，世上的盐”（太5:13-16），在世但不属世（约17:15-17），以出世心态过入世生活（罗12:1-2）。

春节是华人最重要的节日，也是中国文化的核心部分。身处海外的华人基督徒，需要平衡中国文化、西方文化及基督徒文化，荣神益人至关重要。参照尼布尔的“基督更新文化”模式，并依据保罗所说“所以，你们或吃或喝，无论做什么，都要为荣耀神而行”（林前10:31），以下与大家分享几点实践建议：

1. 敬拜独一真神

基督徒当尊上帝为大，只敬拜独一真神，绝不可祭拜偶像（出20:1–5；申5:7–9）。春节期间，应谨慎分辨，避免参与或传播接神、摆贡、贴财神/门神画像、迎财神、抽签算卦等行为；不宣扬别神名号（诗16:4）。

我们尊重每个人，但不以“神”的称呼高举人。不可称影视明星、网络名人为“男神”“女神”，不可将神的仆人当作神（徒14:14-18），也不可把天使当作神（启22:8-9）。祷告时称神为“全能的”（Almighty），而非抽象的“万能力量”。

祷告应存谦卑认罪之心，但无需自谦说“以上不配的祷告”，因为我们得以坦然来到神前，是基于基督在十字架上成就的救恩。

张贴“福”字、福音对联或穿民族特色服饰，如唐装、少数民族服装，只要不涉及敬拜偶像，皆属文化表达。

2. 敬祖但不祭祖（Honor but not Worship Ancestors）

基督徒可以敬祖，却不可祭祖。应怀尊敬与记念的心，而非敬拜或祭祀。华人有“百善孝为先”的传统，圣经十诫第五条也强调孝敬父母。孝道重点在长辈生前的关愛：分享福音、体贴照顾、分担家务，用行动表达感恩。

扫墓时，我们可缅怀长辈美好榜样，感激他们生前的付出。扫墓不磕头、不烧纸、不摆供品，可献花、唱赞美诗，祷告等。祷告时不向死者祷告，而是向上帝为活人求喜乐平安，既荣耀神，也作真实见证。

3. 从前属动物，如今属基督

生肖是华人文化符号：子鼠、丑牛、寅虎、卯兔、辰龙、巳蛇、午马、未羊、申猴、酉鸡、戌狗、亥猪。它对应年份与时辰，但对基督徒而言，只是文化标记，无属灵实质。真正决定人身份的，是人是否属于基督。

今年是马年。圣经谈到马，多与力量、战争和依靠军备有关。诗篇说：“他不喜悦马的力大，不喜愛人的腿快”（诗147:10），提醒我们不应倚靠人的能力、速度，甚至科技发展与人工智能的进步；唯有敬畏主、盼望主慈愛的人，才蒙神喜悦（诗147:11）。《启示录》19:11-21记载耶稣骑白马施行审判，彰显基督权柄与得胜。

基督徒在“马年”彼此祝福，不在于属相的吉利，而在于基督的同在。所谓“以马内利喜乐马上来到”、“以马内利祝福马上环绕”，真正的核心不在“马”，而在“以马内利”——神与我们同在。对我们来说，无论是什么生肖年，都当宣告：今年是基督年。

在日常寒暄中，人常问“你属什么？”我们可以见证：“我从前属羊（或马、蛇），如今属基督了。”正如保罗所言：“只是我先前以为与我有益的，我现在因基督都当做有损…因我以认识我主基督耶稣为至宝”（腓3:7-8）。从属动物到属基督，是生命归属的宣告，彰显恩典，而非文化标签。

4. 吃喝要有节制

春节团圆时，家人会享受丰富饮食。基督徒可保持节制，因为身体是圣灵的殿（林前6:19-20），健康生活既荣耀神，也能祝福他人。吸烟有害健康，出于愛护身体可选择不吸烟；若已有习惯，可倚靠圣灵战胜烟瘾，为主作得胜见证。比如，我的奶奶和美国妈妈都曾抽烟几十年，但靠主的大能成功戒掉，成为身边人的鼓励。

同时，避免醉酒（弗5:18），因贪杯易失态。依靠圣灵追求分别为圣的生活，远离易跌倒之事。所谓“分别为圣”，非仅外表不犯罪，而是以合神心意、荣耀神为生活最高目标，让每个日常选择都成为信仰见证。

5. 抓住机会分享福音

传福音是基督徒使命，无论得时不得时都要传扬福音（提后4:2）。节日期间，给亲人打电话问候时可自然分享福音；参加庆祝活动时，也可与他人分享福音，邀请他们来教会参与聚会。若有人不接受，也无需勉强，应持续保持良好关系，让主的愛与见证长久影响他们。

愿主在新的一年赐福我们：力上加力，恩上加恩，荣上加荣，乐上加乐！愿主恩充溢，福杯满溢；愿“认识耶和华荣耀的知识充满遍地，好像水充满洋海一般”（哈2：14）。以基督名，阿们！
